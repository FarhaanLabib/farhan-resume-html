  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello there! I'm currently immersed in the captivating world of computer science at BRAC University, where I'm eagerly exploring the intricacies of algorithms, programming languages, and everything in between. My journey through the realm of technology has been nothing short of exhilarating, as I continue to unravel the mysteries of this ever-evolving field.</p>

  <p>Beyond the realm of coding and debugging, I find solace in the harmonious notes of music. Singing is not just a hobby for me; it's a passion that ignites my soul and provides an escape from the complexities of life. Whether it's belting out a classic tune or experimenting with new melodies, I find joy and fulfillment in expressing myself through song..</p>
